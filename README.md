# Customized SymSpell SpellCheck Java 
**This customized spell check is is based on the spell correction fuzzy search library [SymSpell](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/symspell) with a few customizations and optimizations**  

## Java Ported v6.6 (Bigrams)
* the optional bigram dictionary in order to use sentence level context information for selecting best spelling correction.


## SymSpell
* The Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm reduces the complexity of edit candidate generation and dictionary lookup for a given Damerau-Levenshtein distance. 
* It is six orders of magnitude faster (than the standard approach with deletes + transposes + replaces + inserts) and language independent.
* Opposite to other algorithms only deletes are required, no transposes + replaces + inserts. Transposes + replaces + inserts of the input term are transformed into deletes of the dictionary term.
* The speed comes from the inexpensive delete-only edit candidate generation and the pre-calculation.

## Customizations
* We replaced the **Damerau-Levenshtein** implementation with a **weighted Damerau-Levenshtein** implementation: where each operation (delete, insert, swap, replace) can have different edit weights.
* We added some customizing "hooks" that are used to rerank the top-k results (candidate list). The results are then reordered based on a combined proximity
  * added keyboard-distance to get a dynamic replacement weight (since letters close to each other are more likely to be replaced)
  * do some query normalization before search
  
## Keyboard based  Qwerty Distance

we used the adjancey graph of the keyboard for the weights to the connected nodes.

### Example
```
For 2 terms: 
        slices  
        olives

If the misspelled word is, slives 
both slices and olives is 1 edit distnace, 
  so in default case the one with higher frequency will end up in the result.
While with the qwerty based char distance,
 slives is more closer to slices.

The reason for this is in Qwerty Based Keyboard, 
 S and O are too far while V and C are adjacent.
```

## Generation of Deletes

Word deletes are generated with taking edit distance which is minimum of max edit distance and 0.3 * word.length

## Benchmark Summary
We have done 3 runs each for 30k and 80k data set, which also includes results for each verbosity level.
After the runs the final benchmarking looks like: 
```
Average Precalculation time instance 30843.33 ms
Average Lookup time instance 138141.09296296295 ns ~ 0.03814 ms
Total Lookup results instance 648092
